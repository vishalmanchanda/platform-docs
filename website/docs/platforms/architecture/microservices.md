# Microservices Architecture

## Design Principles

### Service Independence
- Autonomous deployment
- Independent scaling
- Isolated failures
- Technology flexibility

### Communication Patterns
- Synchronous (REST/gRPC)
- Asynchronous (Events)
- Message queuing
- Service discovery

### Data Management
- Database per service
- Event sourcing
- CQRS patterns
- Data consistency

### Service Boundaries
- Domain-driven design
- Bounded contexts
- Clear interfaces
- Version management

## Implementation Guidelines

### Service Design
- Single responsibility
- API-first approach
- Stateless design
- Idempotent operations

### Resilience Patterns
- Circuit breakers
- Retry policies
- Fallback mechanisms
- Bulkhead pattern

### Monitoring
- Distributed tracing
- Health checks
- Performance metrics
- Log aggregation

### Deployment
- Container orchestration
- Blue-green deployment
- Canary releases
- Rolling updates
